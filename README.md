### 💫 About Me:

Hi I'm Sumbal Zahra 👋<br><br>🔭 I’m currently a student of: Associate Degree in Computer Science at Virtual University of Pakistan.<br><br>🌱 I’m currently learning: Key techniques in Machine Learning and Deep Learning to make healthcare solutions more reliable and interpretable. I’m focusing on developing expertise in Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch for AI applications.<br><br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: Healthcare AI projects, including medical imaging, personalized medicine, and predictive analytics. I’m also interested in innovative AI solutions for real-time applications, such as surgical assistance, ICU monitoring, and, in the long term, workflow optimization in hospitals.<br><br>🤔 I’m looking for help with: Exploring PhD opportunities and funding in AI for Healthcare.<br><br>💬 Ask me about: Why having interdisciplinary knowledge from Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science, and AI is so essential, especially for developing countries like Pakistan. Additionally, I love diving into controversial yet thought-provoking topics that encourage meaningful discussions.<br><br>📫 The best way to reach me: Email: [sumbalzahraameen@gmail.com]<br><br>😄 Pronouns: She/Her<br><br>⚡ Fun fact: Beyond the world of technology, I have a deep passion for exploring languages and cultures, immersing myself in their rich traditions and histories. I love engaging in thought-provoking conversations, especially with aged individuals and patients whose wisdom and life experiences deeply inspire me. While badminton keeps me active, I also find joy in singing—despite long-term throat issues, reciting a few lines of Naat always makes me feel alive and connected. 😊
