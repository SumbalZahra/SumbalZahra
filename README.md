âš¡ Fun fact:
Beyond the world of technology, I have a deep passion for exploring languages and cultures, immersing myself in their rich traditions and histories. I love engaging in thought-provoking conversations, especially with aged individuals and patients whose wisdom and life experiences deeply inspire me. While badminton keeps me active, I also find joy in singingâ€”despite long-term throat issues, reciting a few lines of Naat always makes me feel alive and connected. ðŸ˜Š
